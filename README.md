## 📌 Overview  
Stampedes at **festivals, concerts, rallies, and processions** often occur without warning, leading to chaos, injuries, and loss of life.  
The **Stampede Early Warning System** is an **AI + Simulation-based solution** that predicts overcrowding and alerts authorities **before** tragedy strikes.  

This project was built as a **hackathon prototype** to showcase how technology can **save lives in real-world scenarios** like Ganesh Immersion, Kumbh Mela, concerts, and stadium events.  


## 🚨 Problem  
- Large crowds form unpredictable bottlenecks.  
- Authorities only react **after** panic begins.  
- No existing predictive tool to **warn early** → high risk of fatalities.  



## ✅ Solution  
1. **Crowd Monitoring**  
   - CCTV cameras or simulated agents track **density + movement speed**.  
   - AI flags abnormal velocity patterns or overcrowding.  

2. **Risk Detection**  
   - If thresholds are crossed (e.g., >5 people/m² density), the system triggers a **⚠️ High-Risk Alert**.  

3. **Alerts**  
   - 🔊 **Loudspeakers**: Play calming guidance messages.  
   - 📱 **Mobile Alerts**: Notify event staff & police instantly.  
   - 💡 **LED Boards**: Flash exit directions for the crowd.
